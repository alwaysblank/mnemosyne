# Mnemosyne
#### Get the thing, unless there's a new thing

Mnemosyne is a system that allows for hard-coded defaults to be overwritten by storage-agnostic overrides. This allows for content to be described in depth in a themeâ€™s code but easily overridden by a user if necessary.
 
Named for the [Greek Titan of memory](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne).
